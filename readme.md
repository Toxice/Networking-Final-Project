# Networking Project - Liz, Nicko and Mor

## Current Information:
## DHCP: Server done

## DNS:
### Nicko made his Server
### Objective: simplify the logic, no need for a robust DNS
### create a public serve() function that wraps the logic (Encapsulation)

## Client:
### Objective: create a different socket for every server interaction

## FTP
### 1. currently nothing


# General Concerns:
### 1. we need to work with python structs to implement the DNS and DHCP protocols
### 2. we can use the Scapy library, its best on Linux
