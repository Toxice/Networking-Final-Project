# Networking Project - Liz, Nicko and Mor

## Current Information:
## DHCP:
### 1. we have a UDP socket listening on port 67.
### 2. we need to implement the DHCP requests and responses by the RFC, preferably with a new class made for that

## DNS:
### 1. currently nothing


# General Concerns:
### 1. we need to work with python structs to implement the DNS and DHCP protocols
### 2. we can use the Scapy library, its best on Linux
